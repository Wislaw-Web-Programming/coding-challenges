Coding Challenge: Create a Custom-Styled List

Challenge:
Design and style a custom list using HTML.

Instructions:



1. Inside the `<body>` section, create three different lists:
   - Start with an unordered list (`<ul>`) containing three list items (`<li>`). These items will form your initial, unstyled list.
   - Create an ordered list (`<ol`) with three list items (`<li>`). This will be another unstyled list.
   - Lastly, design a new unordered list (`<ul>`) and assign it the class "styled-list."

2. Populate the "styled-list" with three list items (`<li>`) and provide your own content. This list will be styled differently.

3. Apply custom styles to only the "styled-list" by utilizing CSS. These styles should:
   - Remove list-style markers (bullets or numbers).
